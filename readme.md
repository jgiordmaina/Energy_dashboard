# Meter Reading Application

## Overview

The **Meter Reading Application** allows users to submit their meter readings along with the reading date and the name of the person submitting the reading. The application consists of a **React frontend** and an **Express.js backend**, and communicates between the two via a REST API.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure that you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** (Latest LTS): [Download Here](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- **npm** (Installed with Node.js)
- **Git**: [Download Here](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- **Postman** or **cURL** for API testing (Optional)

---

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: React.js
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
- **HTTP Client**: Axios

---

## Project Setup

### Clone the Repository

To get started, clone the repository to your local machine:

\`\`\`bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/meter-reading-app.git
\`\`\`

Navigate into the project directory:

\`\`\`bash
cd meter-reading-app
\`\`\`

### Backend Setup

1. **Navigate to the \`backend\` folder**:

\`\`\`bash
cd backend
\`\`\`

2. **Install Backend Dependencies**:

\`\`\`bash
npm install
\`\`\`

3. **Run the Backend**:

Start the backend server using \`nodemon\` for auto-reload during development:

\`\`\`bash
npm run dev
\`\`\`

If \`nodemon\` is not installed, you can install it globally with:

\`\`\`bash
npm install -g nodemon
\`\`\`

Alternatively, you can run the server directly with \`node\`:

\`\`\`bash
node index.js
\`\`\`

The backend will run on \`http://localhost:5000\`.

4. **Backend API Example**:

The backend exposes an API endpoint for submitting meter readings. You can test it using Postman or \`cURL\`.

- **POST** \`http://localhost:5000/api/meterreadings\`
- **Sample Request Body**:

\`\`\`json
{
  "personName": "John Doe",
  "readingDate": "2024-09-22",
  "meterValue": 1234.56
}
\`\`\`

- **Response**:

\`\`\`json
{
  "message": "Reading submitted successfully."
}
\`\`\`

---

### Frontend Setup

1. **Navigate to the \`frontend\` folder**:

\`\`\`bash
cd frontend
\`\`\`

2. **Install Frontend Dependencies**:

\`\`\`bash
npm install
\`\`\`

3. **Set Up Environment Variables**:

In the \`frontend\` directory, create a \`.env\` file with the following contents to set the backend API URL:

\`\`\`env
REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:5000/api
\`\`\`

4. **Run the Frontend**:

Start the React development server:

\`\`\`bash
npm start
\`\`\`

The React app will run on \`http://localhost:3000\`.

---

## Running the Application Locally

### Running the Backend

1. Navigate to the \`backend\` directory:

\`\`\`bash
cd backend
\`\`\`

2. Run the backend server:

\`\`\`bash
npm run dev
\`\`\`

The backend will be available at \`http://localhost:5000\`.

### Running the Frontend

1. Navigate to the \`frontend\` directory:

\`\`\`bash
cd frontend
\`\`\`

2. Start the frontend React development server:

\`\`\`bash
npm start
\`\`\`

The frontend will be available at \`http://localhost:3000\`.

---

## Testing the Application

### Testing the Frontend

1. Open \`http://localhost:3000\` in your browser.
2. Fill out the form with the following fields:
   - **Person Name**
   - **Reading Date**
   - **Meter Value**
3. Submit the form. You should see a success message indicating the submission of the meter reading.

### Testing the Backend with Postman or cURL

To manually test the backend:

1. Open **Postman** or use **cURL**.
2. Make a \`POST\` request to the backend API:

\`\`\`bash
POST http://localhost:5000/api/meterreadings
\`\`\`

3. Include the following JSON in the request body:

\`\`\`json
{
  "personName": "John Doe",
  "readingDate": "2024-09-22",
  "meterValue": 1234.56
}
\`\`\`

4. Check the response. It should return:

\`\`\`json
{
  "message": "Reading submitted successfully."
}
\`\`\`

---

## Troubleshooting and Common Issues

### Issue 1: \`nodemon\` Not Installed
If \`nodemon\` is not recognized when running \`npm run dev\`, install it globally:

\`\`\`bash
npm install -g nodemon
\`\`\`

### Issue 2: CORS Issues
If you encounter CORS issues when submitting from the frontend to the backend, make sure CORS is enabled in the backend:

\`\`\`javascript
const cors = require('cors');
app.use(cors());
\`\`\`

### Issue 3: Environment Variables Not Loaded
Ensure that the \`.env\` file is correctly set up in the frontend with the backend API URL:

\`\`\`env
REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:5000/api
\`\`\`

---

## Summary

By following these instructions, you will be able to run both the backend and frontend of the **Meter Reading Application** locally. You can submit readings through the form on the frontend and receive them on the backend, which can be tested with Postman or cURL.
